# CLAUDE.md

## Workflow rules

Always immediately push all changes to main on github https://github.com/Jonizs/ESTER

Jonas works on more than one machine, and every launcher resolves its own
location (`%~dp0`, `$PSScriptRoot`), so the clone can live in any folder -
nothing is tied to a particular path. Known clones so far:

- `C:\Users\jonas\Desktop\ESTER`
- `C:\Users\TEMP.KVDG.034\Desktop\ester`

Claude runs in a remote container and cannot write to any of them, so after
every push tell Jonas to double-click `UPDATE.bat` in whichever clone he is
using - it pulls origin/main, installs any new dependencies and rebuilds. If
`WATCH.bat` is running there it picks the push up on its own within ~10
seconds. A fresh machine needs `git clone` once, then `SETUP.bat`.

Nothing in the game is saved to disk, so there is no state to move between
machines.

## History

The LAZER colony-sim prototype was removed on request; the project is back to
the island with a single inhabitant. Two reference points are kept:

- Branch `lazer-base` (commit `1390074`) - the bare island, before any of it.
- Commit `ee042f8` on `main` - the full colony sim (colonists, jobs, research,
  raids, events), if any of it is ever wanted back.

Neither is needed day to day. Do not delete the `lazer-base` branch.

## Project

ESTER is a 3D space survival game. Right now it is a voxel island in the void
with one inhabitant who walks around and works on what is there.

- **Engine:** Three.js (WebGL), bundled with Vite, wrapped in Electron so it
  ships as a desktop executable.
- **Entry point:** `src/main.js` - renderer, scene, render loop.
- **Modules:**
  - `src/island.js` - voxel island, and the surface heightmap everything
    standing on it uses (`group.userData.surface`, keyed `"x,z"`).
  - `src/space.js` - nebula shell, stars and lighting.
  - `src/orbitCamera.js` - quaternion orbit camera.
  - `src/noise.js` - deterministic value noise.
  - `src/props.js` - the few trees, rocks and flowers.
  - `src/person.js` - the single inhabitant: walking, tasks, current action.
  - `src/path.js` - A* across the surface cells.
- **Desktop shell:** `electron/main.cjs`.
- **Web deploy:** `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` builds and publishes
  `dist/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`
  (https://jonizs.github.io/ESTER/). Vite's `base` is `'./'` so the same
  bundle works from the Pages subpath and from `file://` inside Electron -
  do not change it to an absolute path.

## Rules that are easy to break

- **The ground is `y + 0.5`, not `y + 1`.** Island blocks are unit cubes
  *centred* on their cell coordinate, so a column whose top block is at `y`
  has its walkable face half a block higher. Use `GROUND_OFFSET` from
  `props.js`; `y + 1` leaves everything hovering.
- **Layer the island by depth from the surface, not from each column's
  bottom.** The keel's visible faces *are* the bottom blocks of its columns,
  so keying bedrock off `bottom` painted the whole island body bedrock and
  produced zero stone. Bedrock is now limited to the deepest few blocks of
  the whole isle; everything under the soil is stone.
- **Keep the fill lights near neutral.** Saturated blue rim and ambient
  light stains the flanks and the stone stops reading as stone.
- **Keep the heightmap free of single-cell pits.** Rounding the noise creates
  one-block dents whose walls face away from the sun and read as hard dark
  blotches on open ground. `island.js` runs two median passes over the
  columns to remove them - check `isolatedPits` is still 0 after touching
  terrain generation.
- **Blocky geometry needs `shadow.normalBias`.** With a depth bias alone the
  island self-shadows into dark half-quad triangles. The sun uses
  `normalBias: 0.06` and a frustum wrapped tightly around the isle; widening
  that frustum wastes shadow texels and the acne comes back.

- **Nothing in the scene drifts.** The island does not bob or rotate, the
  stars do not turn, and there is no debris belt. Idle motion was removed on
  request - do not reintroduce it.
- **The person's `action` is user-facing text.** It is rendered above their
  head every frame, so it must always be a readable sentence
  ("Chopping wood"), never an internal state name.
- **`onFinish` runs after the fallback action is set**, so a callback's
  message ("Collected a flower") is what stays on screen.
- **Props must not block pathing.** `path.js` only refuses steps of more than
  one block of height; keeping props walkable avoids pockets the person can
  never leave.
- **Keep the isle sparse.** A few trees, rocks and flowers - counts live in
  `COUNTS` in `props.js`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm install` | Install dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:5173 |
| `npm run electron:dev` | Dev server + Electron window together |
| `npm start` | Build then launch the desktop app |
| `npm run build` | Production bundle into `dist/` |
| `npm run build:exe` | Package `dist-exe/ESTER.exe` (run on Windows) |

## Testing the game

There is no test runner. Drive the built game in headless Chromium with
Playwright against `npx vite preview`. `window.ESTER` exposes `scene`,
`camera`, `controls`, `island`, `person`, `props` and `surface`.

To check behaviour without waiting on real time, call `person.update(dt,
props, onFinish)` in a loop rather than sleeping - a whole work cycle then
takes milliseconds.

Note that headless rendering uses SwiftShader, so frame times there are
software-rendered and meaningless; measure `game.update()` separately.

## Conventions

- ES modules, no TypeScript, no framework - plain Three.js.
- Keep world generation deterministic: seeded noise in `src/noise.js`, no
  bare `Math.random()` in generation code, so the island is identical on
  every launch.
- Use `InstancedMesh` for anything blocky and repeated; the island is one
  instanced mesh per material layer.
- Rotation in the camera is quaternion-based on purpose - do not reintroduce
  Euler pitch clamping, the camera must be able to orbit fully in every
  direction.
